/* Forward -biased Junction*/

/* Description */

When positive terminal of battery is connected to p-side and negative terminal to N-side of P-N junction,
holes in p-side are repelled by the positive terminal and electrons in N-side are repelled by the negative
terminal with the result that both the electrons and holes are driven towards the junction where they recombine.The internal potential barrier at the junction
is reduced.if the applied bias voltage is increased from zero,the barrier potential gets progressively smaller until it effectively
disappears and charge carriers can easily flow across to the negative terminal of the battery on the N-side.Thus a majority carrier current flows and the junction is said to be forward biase
shows the forward characteristics of a p-n junction.

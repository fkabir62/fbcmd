Time and time again for you 
and i'm weightless ,falling in love
i am weigthless
and i don't know why but i know
 it's all right
all i can hear
is my own breating
Echo in my loneliness

if i could sleep
i would be dreaming
of the sweetness of your kiss
and i'm weigthless ,falling in love
i'm weigthless
and i don't kno why but i know 
it's all right ",10,100);
